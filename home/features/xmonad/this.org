* Dissatisfaction
- The color for certain themes makes the active window hard to discern
- The docks are very finicky, often not being recognized, polybar?
- Better keybindings for 3-screen management
  - Would really like a second button. Mod4/shift?
  - I do not like the button on my '/' (QMK issue)


* Possible improvements
